    <strong>LAB-1:</strong>
    In Lab 1 - Foundations of the Web, I had the opportunity to delve into key aspects of web technologies and programming. The lab was divided into three main parts, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the fundamentals of the web.

    During the initial phase, I focused on gaining insights into the basics of the Web and HTTP protocol. Tasks included becoming familiar with the Wireshark tool and HTTP protocol, as well as exploring HTTP using telnet and Wireshark. Engaging in hands-on activities, I captured and analyzed network traffic, applied display filters, and examined HTTP packets. This allowed me to grasp essential elements such as request methods, URLs, response codes, headers, and payload content.

    Moving on to the second and third part of the lab, I delved into CGI web applications in C and created a simple PHP web application that involved user input by creating helloworld.php and echo.php. The tasks in this phase ranged from developing a Hello World and index CGI program to deploying it on an Apache web server. Furthermore, I gained a deeper understanding of HTTP GET and POST requests. As part of the exploration, we also delved into identifying security risks in a PHP web application that accepts user input.

    Throughout the entire lab experience, I followed detailed instructions provided in Lecture 3's slides. To ensure organization and accessibility, all code and documentation were systematically arranged within a dedicated GitHub repository, specifically under the labs/lab1 folder. https://github.com/dugginsi/waph-dugginsi/tree/main/labs/lab1.
    
    <strong>LAB-2:</strong>
    I have gained knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML which are essential in creating the structure of web pages, incorporating components such as text, images, and forms. I have also advanced my skills by learning client-side JavaScript to add dynamic content and using external scripts for more intricate interactions. Further, I have explored AJAX to update web content without needing page reloads and CSS for styling. I have implemented jQuery to simplify HTML manipulation and event handling, thus enhancing my front-end web development skills.
    
    <strong>HACKATHON:</strong>
    In the initial phase of our hackathon, I directed my attention toward exploring the nuances of seven distinct tiers of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Commencing with Level 0, I initiated by crafting rudimentary JavaScript alerts embedded within input fields. Progressing steadily, I delved into more intricate methodologies encompassing manipulation of URL parameters, exploitation of form inputs, and devising strategies to circumvent server-side sanitization mechanisms. Each tier, spanning from 0 to 6, presented its unique challenges, necessitating a hacker's ingenuity and innovative coding approaches to effectively execute scripts featuring a personalized "Level X-hacked by Shobha Duggineni" message.

    Transitioning now to Task 2, my primary focus lies in fortifying our code against potential security vulnerabilities. Specifically, I'm focusing on enhancing the input validation mechanisms within the echo.php file from Lab 1. This entails the implementation of stringent validation protocols and ensuring meticulous data encoding to mitigate the risk of any malicious exploits. Furthermore, as we proceed with the development of our front-end prototype in Lab 2, I am meticulous in identifying all external data channels and enforcing rigorous validation and sanitization procedures to guarantee the security of the data presented on our webpage. Through the iterative process of attack and defense, I am gaining invaluable insights into the intricate dynamics of ethical hacking. This practical, hands-on approach not only fosters engagement but also plays a pivotal role to the adoption of best practices for web security.
